Age of Berk was my first project with a team. I was the main programmer. The rest of the team made models, textures, and animations. I put them in a resource pack and made the behavior pack. I made blocks, entities, items, structures, and more using both JSON and JavaScript.

I joined in Janurary of 2024. I left in November of 2025 when I realized many of the resources I was provided were stolen. Despite much of the content of the add-on being stolen, my work was my own and remains some of my best.
